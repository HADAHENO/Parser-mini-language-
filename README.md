# Mini-Language Parser

This project implements a mini-language parser using both imperative and functional approaches in Python. The goal is to demonstrate how to parse a simple language using two different programming paradigms.

## Features

- **Imperative Parser:** Implements the mini-language using an imperative approach.
- **Functional Parser:** Implements the mini-language using a functional approach.
- **Local Execution:** Users can run the code on their local machine using Python.
- **Online Execution:** Users can run the code online using a web-based Python interpreter.

## Installation

To run the project locally, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Local Execution
Imperative Parser
To use the imperative parser, run the following command:
python imperative_parser.py "https://github.com/HADAHENO/Parser-mini-language-/blob/main/paradigm/Functional-Paradigm.ipynb"
Functional Parser
To use the functional parser, run the following command:
python functional_parser.py "https://github.com/HADAHENO/Parser-mini-language-/blob/main/paradigm/Imperative-Paradigm.ipynb"
Online Execution
You can also run the code online using a web-based Python interpreter like Replit or Google Colab.

Copy the code from imperative_parser.py or functional_parser.py.

Paste it into the online interpreter.

Run the code with your mini-language input.

Mini-Language Examples
Here are some examples of the mini-language that can be parsed by this project:
print "Hello, World!"
x = 5
y = 10
print x + y
